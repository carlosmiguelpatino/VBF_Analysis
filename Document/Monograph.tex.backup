\section{MadGraph Simulation} \label{sec: mgsim}

The MadGraph simulation was performed assuming the mass of the heavy neutrino was 1.5 TeV. Also, taking into the account that the analysis was going to be performed using Vector Boson Fusion, the paramater of minimum pseudorapidity ($\eta$) separation between two jets for WBF process was set to 3.5.

The commands used to generate the desired signal were the ones shown in Figure \ref{fig: mgCommands}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig: mgCommands}
\end{figure}

The first command imports the theoretical model that includes the interactions of the heavy neutrino. The next command specifies the processes that are going to be simulated. pp $>$ n3 ta+ jj stands por the proton-proton collision that decays into a heavy neutrino, a $\tau$ with positive charge, and two jets. The flag QCD=0 is used to exclude all strong interactions that can be involved in the process. Finally, n3 $>$ ta+ jj is used to force the decay of the heavy neutrino into a $\tau$ charge positively and two jets. The subsequent commands are used to take into account all the possible combinations of the electrical charge that the $\tau$ may have.

Figures \ref{fig: hnZ} and \ref{fig: hnGamma} show two of the main possible diagrams generated by MadGraph for the processes simulated. This two diagrams present a complete picture involving the processes shown in the diagrams of Figures \ref{fig: VBF} and \ref{fig: W}. Figure \ref{fig: VBF} shows the diagram of the vector boson fusion process, ocurring in Figures \ref{fig: hnZ} and \ref{fig: hnGamma} in the fusion of the W boson with the Z boson and the photon ($\gamma$) respectively. In these last two diagrams, the decay of the of the W boson coincides with the one shown in Figure \ref{fig: W} for the decay of the W boson resulting in a heavy neutrino and a lepton, which in this case is a $\tau$.

\section{Definitions} \label{sec:definitions}

\subsection{Variable Definitions}

The transverse momentum or $p_{T}$, is defined as the momentum component that a particle has in the plane perpendicular to the beam line. In the coordinate system of the LHC, this plane corresponds to the $x-y$ plane.

The variable related with the polar angle in the LHC is called pseudorapidity, or $\eta$, defined as in Equation \ref{eq: eta}. The use of this variable is justified for mainly two reasons. The first one is that $\Delta \eta$, contrary to $\Delta \theta$, is a Lorentz invariant. This makes $\Delta \eta$ a more natural variable than $\Delta \theta$ for relativistic calculations. The second reason is that the distribution of the values of $\eta$ in barrel region, where the multiplicity of particle is less than in the end-caps, is wider allowing the $\eta$ particle distribution to be aproximately constant.

\begin{equation}
 \eta = -\ln\left[\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right]
 \label{eq: eta}
\end{equation}

In the preliminary analysis of the variable distributions shape using normalized to the unit plots, i.e. the area under the distribution for the distribution is equal to one, a separation between signal and background was achieved in the transverse momentum variable of both jets and taus. However, in distribution involving all the cuts considered fothe analysis, the separation noticeable but considerably smaller. The separation between background and signal was bigger for the tau transverse momentum $p_{T}(\tau)$ than the one shown by both leading and sub-leading jets.

With the idea of exploiting the small but existent different between signal and background in the $p_{T}$ varibles, two new variables shown in Equations \ref{eq: HT} and \ref{eq: ST} were created to check for possible further separation between signal and background. As shown in equation \ref{eq: HT}, the $H_{T}$ variable is defined as the scalar sum of the jets with $p_{T}$ greater than 30 GeV and $|\eta| < 5$ that are not B-jets. $S_{T}$ is defined as the scalar sum of jets that fullfilll the same conditions of $H_{T}$, added to the $p_{T}$ of the $\tau$'s in the event. 

Since the $\tau$ selection is important for this analysis, it is relevant to provide a further description of the selection criteria for the $\tau$'s in the simulated events. For starters, a jet identified as a tau is considered a valid $\tau$ if it has minimum a transverse momentum of 20 GeV. Also, it was required that a valid $\tau$ should not overlap with an electron or a muon. That is, the $\Delta R$, defined as $\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2 + (\Delta \phi)^2}$ should not be less than 0.3. This condition guarantees that the jet identified as a $\tau$ does not overlap with other leptons. Other condition required for a valid $\tau$ is that the jet has a minimum transverse momentum of 20 GeV. Since the final state for this analysis includes two $tau$'s, the two taus with greater $p_{T}$ are selected among a maximum of three taus stored for each event. The leading $\tau$ is the one with highest $p_{T}$ and the sub-leading $\tau$ is the one with second highest $p_{T}$.    

\begin{equation}
 H_{T} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{T}(jet_{i})
 \label{eq: HT}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 S_{T} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{T}(jet_{i}) + \sum_{j=1}^{m} p_{T}(\tau_{j})
 \label{eq: ST}
\end{equation}

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:definitions}, the variables $H_{T}$ and $S_{T}$ were defined to achieve a greater separation between background and signal. Figures \ref{fig: HTunitNC} and \ref{fig: STunitNC} show normalized to the unity plots with no additional cuts in the variables. The plots in both figures show that a separation between signal and background is achieved for values greater than 500 GeV for both $H_{T}$ and $S_{T}$.
