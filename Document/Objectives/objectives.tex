\section{General Objectives}

Conduct a phenomenological study to determine the possible experimental sensitivity of heavy neutrino searches in the LHC, using the VBF topology, in channels with high-mass resonance production.

\section{Specific Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop the signal events and experimental noise simulations using MadGraph, Pythia, and Delphes software.
	\item Write an analysis code using ROOT software to analyze the simulated data.
	\item Conduct a physical study of the appropiate cinematic and topological variables that show strong separation between signal and background.
	\item Find the optimal cut points of the relevant physical variables using a significance figure.
    \item Conduct a statical analysis of the results.
\end{itemize}
